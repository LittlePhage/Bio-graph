# Bio-graph

Originally, R code was written with the intention to create a bar graph comparing different conditions cells were incubated in and the resulting fluorescence.
Although I was a part of the work, I do not own the project and thus cannot disclose further details.
The original data used has been removed but a viable template for future bar graphs is provided here.
This template works best when comparing different variables ie time (24 hours vs 48 hours), temperature, humidity to give a few examples.
The underlying code is extremely flexible and can represent different forms of data with miminal alterations.

An example of the bar graph generated by the code template, using a dataset preloaded in R:
